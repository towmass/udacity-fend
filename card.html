			<p>This bear-like creature can be found in the Nepal, India, Bhutan, China, Laos and Myanmar. Red panda lives in mountain
				forests. Intense deforestation resulted in great reduction in the number of red pandas in the wild. Other than habitat
				loss, number of red pandas is decreased through uncontrolled hunt because of the fur. Red panda is listed as endangered
				species.
